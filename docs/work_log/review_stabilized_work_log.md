# Review Stabilized Work Log

This file is the durable Codex work log for `review-stabilized`.

Purpose: make engineering/audit work visible in git, including what was found,
what changed, why that change was chosen, expected outcome, verification, and
remaining risk.

## Logging Rule

Every future Codex change that affects code, docs, tests, runtime policy,
operator workflow, or gate behavior must add or update an entry here before
handoff.

Minimum entry fields:
- date/time or commit SHA
- active role and objective
- what was found
- what changed
- why that change was chosen
- expected outcome
- verification run, or why verification was not run
- remaining risk and acceptance state

High-risk work must end at `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW` in this log until a
separate reviewer or human accepts it.

## Retrospective Scope

SHOWN:
- The current branch is `review-stabilized`.
- Recent visible commit history is available through `git log --oneline`.
- Recent verification results were captured in this thread for the latest gate
  and monitor changes.

UNVERIFIED:
- Older commit intent can only be reconstructed from commit messages and visible
  repo artifacts unless a decision record or command output is present.
- This retrospective is therefore a best-effort reconstruction, not a substitute
  for the original review transcript.

## 2026-05-27 - Paper Gate Threshold and Manual Review

Commit: `84aa49113 fix: align paper gate threshold with slow turnover`

Active role: `ENGINEER` then `GATE`

Objective: make the paper-stage round-trip threshold coherent for a daily
slow-turnover strategy without implying profitability.

What was found:
- SHOWN: `check_promotion_gates.py` reported `7/50, 43 remaining`.
- SHOWN: `docs/DECISION_FRAMEWORK.md` and
  `docs/strategies/es_daily_trend_v1.md` used a 50+ paper round-trip gate.
- SHOWN: the strategy spec says the holding period is days to months, making
  50 paper round trips an impractical paper-to-sandbox blocker.
- SHOWN: the machine gate checked positive average PnL but did not machine-check
  win rate and avg win/loss against backtest expectations.

What changed:
- Paper-stage round-trip threshold changed from `50` to `10` in
  `services/control/promotion_thresholds.py`.
- Gate label and progress output changed to `10+ completed round trips`.
- `50+` was retained in docs as a later research/live-capital confidence floor.
- `check_promotion_gates.py` now emits:
  - `machine_ready`
  - `manual_review_required`
  - `manual_review`
- The manual-review block surfaces the outstanding win-rate and avg win/loss vs
  backtest comparison and includes observed paper-history metrics.
- Docs now state that 10+ round trips validates the paper execution path and
  does not prove profitability.

Why this change:
- A slow daily strategy cannot reasonably be blocked from sandbox/shadow review
  by a threshold that may require months or years.
- Lowering the paper threshold without surfacing manual review would create a
  false readiness signal.
- Keeping `50+` as a later confidence floor preserves the stronger evidence bar
  for larger live-capital decisions.

Expected outcome:
- The machine gate reports current progress as `7/10, 3 remaining`.
- Even after machine thresholds pass, `ready=false` while manual review remains
  outstanding.
- Operators see that sandbox/shadow review is path validation, not a
  profitability endorsement.

Verification:
- `./.venv/bin/python scripts/check_promotion_gates.py --json`
  - SHOWN: `7/10, 3 remaining`
  - SHOWN: `manual_review_required=true`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/test_check_promotion_gates.py tests/test_paper_promotion_progress.py tests/test_paper_sim_monitor.py tests/test_strategy_evidence_runtime.py tests/test_dashboard_page_runtime.py`
  - SHOWN: `67 passed`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q`
  - SHOWN: `1907 passed, 33 skipped`

Remaining risk:
- HIGH: promotion-gate policy and financial/operator decision logic.
- Acceptance state: `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW`.

## 2026-05-27 - Paper Promotion Progress in Monitor

Commit: `9f90a8d2e feat: surface paper promotion progress in monitor`

Active role: `ENGINEER` then `GATE`

Objective: make promotion-gate progress visible in the paper sim monitor and
Operations dashboard so the operator does not have to poll CLI output manually.

What was found:
- SHOWN: `check_promotion_gates.py --json` exposed remaining day and round-trip
  thresholds.
- SHOWN: paper sim monitor status exposed current campaign state and watches but
  did not include authoritative promotion threshold progress.
- SHOWN: stopped monitor status could preserve a stale PID and report
  `pid_alive=true` after the PID file disappeared.

What changed:
- Added service-layer promotion threshold helpers:
  - `services/control/promotion_thresholds.py`
  - `services/control/paper_promotion_progress.py`
- Paper sim monitor now includes `promotion_progress`,
  `promotion_thresholds_ready`, and `promotion_progress_summary`.
- Operations dashboard table now shows promotion threshold readiness and
  progress.
- Stopped monitor status no longer trusts stale status PIDs unless the monitor is
  running or starting.
- `docs/GOLDEN_PATH.md` documents that the monitor surfaces promotion progress.

Why this change:
- Operator-facing monitor output should distinguish current campaign evidence
  from promotion readiness.
- The service-layer helper preserves the repo rule against services importing
  scripts.
- Stale PID correction prevents reused OS PIDs from making a stopped monitor look
  alive.

Expected outcome:
- Monitor and dashboard show threshold progress directly.
- A local monitor recommendation cannot be mistaken for promotion readiness.
- Stopped monitor status reconciles correctly.

Verification:
- `./.venv/bin/python scripts/run_paper_sim_monitor.py --status`
  - SHOWN: promotion progress appeared in status.
  - SHOWN: stopped monitor reported `pid=null`, `pid_alive=false`.
- Targeted monitor/dashboard/gate tests:
  - SHOWN: `66 passed`
- `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q`
  - SHOWN: `1906 passed, 33 skipped`

Remaining risk:
- HIGH: background-job/operator gate visibility.
- Acceptance state: `READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW` before later acceptance.

## 2026-05-27 - Promotion Gate Output Clarity

Commits:
- `183ac148e fix: suppress passed gate hints`
- `4354ca665 fix: show remaining paper gate thresholds`

Active role: `ENGINEER`

Objective: make gate output more actionable and reduce operator confusion.

What was found:
- SHOWN: passed gates could still include remediation hints.
- SHOWN: threshold gates did not clearly show remaining days/trips.

What changed:
- Passed gates now suppress hints.
- Paper days and round-trip gates now include observed/required counts and
  remaining counts.

Why this change:
- Passed gate hints make status output look degraded when it is not.
- Remaining counts are the operator's next-action data.

Expected outcome:
- Gate output should focus attention on actual blockers.
- Operators can see exactly how many days/trips remain.

Verification:
- SHOWN from prior handoff: targeted tests passed.
- SHOWN from later full-suite runs: full suite passed after these changes.

Remaining risk:
- LOW to MEDIUM: reporting-only, but promotion-gate output influences operator
  decisions.
- Acceptance state: accepted by later review.

## 2026-05-27 - No-Trade Evidence Windows and Script Compatibility

Commits:
- `7bf129bd5 fix: allow no-trade evidence windows`
- `108cbc403 fix: restore root script compatibility`

Active role: `ENGINEER`

Objective: prevent valid no-trade daily sessions and root script entrypoints
from blocking the evidence campaign.

What was found:
- SHOWN: daily paper runs can validly produce signal/session evidence without
  orders or fills.
- SHOWN: root script compatibility wrappers had regressed.

What changed:
- Promotion evidence presence allows no-trade windows when signal and session
  logs exist and no order/fill was expected.
- Root `scripts.*` compatibility wrappers were restored.

Why this change:
- A slow strategy often produces no trade on a valid day; treating that as an
  evidence failure makes the campaign unusable.
- Root script compatibility keeps documented operator commands runnable.

Expected outcome:
- No-trade daily sessions count as valid operational evidence.
- Existing script invocation paths continue to work.

Verification:
- SHOWN from prior handoff:
  - no-trade change full suite: `1902 passed, 33 skipped`
  - script compatibility full suite: `1900 passed, 33 skipped`

Remaining risk:
- MEDIUM: evidence semantics affect gate outcomes.
- Acceptance state: accepted by later review.

## 2026-05-26 - Evidence Provenance and Gate Trust

Visible commits:
- `49c4570b7 fix: skip unattributed signal evidence`
- `2f44b97ad fix: report unknown provenance sources`
- `074856eb2 fix: report latest evidence log window in promotion gate`
- `b47bc3fed fix: require recent kill switch test in promotion gate`
- `705c6a10b fix: keep backtests out of runtime evidence`
- `6520636ad fix: align promotion gate paper history counts`
- `836cb42b7 fix: preserve paper evidence provenance`
- `f461a131c fix: require promotion evidence provenance`
- `1de9a3513 fix: stamp signal evidence provenance`

Active role: `ENGINEER`

Objective: make promotion evidence attributable, current-window based, and
separate from synthetic/backtest evidence.

What was found:
- SHOWN by commit history: the branch had repeated fixes around provenance,
  latest-window reporting, kill-switch recency, and paper-history counts.
- SHOWN by current gate output: current-window provenance is reported separately
  from all-time historical provenance diagnostics.

What changed:
- Signal evidence gained market-data provenance stamping.
- Unattributed signal evidence is skipped for promotion use.
- Promotion gates require non-sample provenance.
- Unknown provenance sources are reported.
- Latest-window evidence log status is reported.
- Kill-switch gate checks recency.
- Runtime evidence excludes backtest-derived evidence.
- Paper-history counts align with the trade journal.

Why this change:
- Promotion gates must not pass on synthetic, stale, or unattributed evidence.
- Latest-window checks prevent old bad/missing evidence from blocking a valid
  current evidence cycle while preserving diagnostics.

Expected outcome:
- Gate readiness is based on current, attributable paper evidence.
- Historical unknown/missing provenance remains visible as a diagnostic without
  automatically blocking the latest valid window.

Verification:
- SHOWN from later full-suite runs: full suite passed after these commits.
- UNVERIFIED: exact targeted command output for each individual commit is not in
  this retrospective.

Remaining risk:
- HIGH: promotion evidence logic.
- Acceptance state: accepted by later review.

## 2026-05-18 to 2026-05-26 - Paper Campaign Monitor and Operator Workflow

Visible commits:
- `92c2c35d7 feat: show paper sim monitor in home digest`
- `6f7482623 feat: add paper sim desktop alert setting`
- `6fcf705f8 fix: surface paper sim notification truth`
- `c3f61c15b feat: add dashboard paper sim watch controls`
- `b6ade1c66 feat: add paper sim watch notifications`
- `ada32aa7d fix: break digest monitor import cycle`
- `215fe908d fix: tighten home digest paper sim monitor wiring`
- `9f8efe2c2 Update test_dashboard_home_digest.py`
- `92626d032 feat: surface paper_sim_monitor in home digest builder`
- `6dc87550c fix: reconcile stopped paper sim monitor summary`
- `b1a470534 fix: surface paper evidence persistence phase`
- `c965f9786 fix: name evidence persistence in monitor summary`
- `73bb81d4c fix: supervise paper evidence collection daily`
- `08793e700 fix: surface idle paper evidence collector state`

Active role: `ENGINEER`

Objective: reduce manual polling by making paper evidence collection and monitor
state visible through runtime status, dashboard, home digest, watches, and
notifications.

What was found:
- SHOWN by commit history and current runtime status: the repo has a managed
  daily paper evidence collector and a paper sim monitor.
- SHOWN by current status: collector can be idle while waiting for the next UTC
  day and still be healthy.

What changed:
- Home digest surfaces paper sim monitor state.
- Dashboard Operations exposes monitor watch controls.
- Paper sim monitor can write watch reports and local desktop notification
  status.
- Paper evidence collector runs in a managed daily-loop path.
- Runtime summaries distinguish idle, persisting evidence, completed, stopped,
  and notification states.

Why this change:
- The operator should not have to remember files or manually poll low-level
  artifacts to know whether the campaign is working.
- Watch reports and notifications turn important state changes into durable
  artifacts.

Expected outcome:
- Operator can see campaign and monitor status from dashboard/home surfaces.
- Meaningful events such as fills, position closes, campaign completion, and
  investigate recommendations are visible.

Verification:
- SHOWN from later full-suite runs: full suite passed after these commits.
- UNVERIFIED: exact targeted command output for every listed commit is not in
  this retrospective.

Remaining risk:
- HIGH: background job/operator workflow.
- Acceptance state: accepted by later review.

## 2026-05-18 to 2026-05-26 - Evidence Artifacts and Decision Records

Visible commits:
- `c1fbd6372 docs: add 2026-05-26 strategy decision record`
- `5ab5f3cee docs: refresh 2026-05-18 decision record`
- `27f6b8ab5 docs: add 2026-05-18 strategy decision record`
- `f73a3d069 docs: track master integration blocker`
- `89ee99159 fix: scope runtime ignore rules`
- `e3248ffff fix: restore script alignment wrappers`
- `ff2e3fba1 fix: bootstrap nested script entrypoints`
- `30d465ea7 fix: tolerate missing parity strategy config`

Active role: `ENGINEER`

Objective: keep evidence artifacts, decision records, ignore rules, and script
entrypoints aligned with the active branch state.

What was found:
- SHOWN by current docs: strategy decision records exist for 2026-05-18 and
  2026-05-26.
- SHOWN by commit history: runtime ignore rules, script wrappers, nested
  bootstraps, and missing parity strategy config were addressed.

What changed:
- Added/refreshed strategy decision records.
- Documented a master integration blocker.
- Scoped runtime ignore behavior.
- Restored alignment wrappers and nested script bootstrap paths.
- Tolerated missing parity strategy config.

Why this change:
- Decision records need to match canonical evidence, not temp proof artifacts.
- Script entrypoints and ignores must not create recurring git dirt or broken
  operator commands.

Expected outcome:
- Audit artifacts are tracked where appropriate.
- Temp/runtime artifacts do not recur as untracked git noise.
- Script paths remain runnable from documented entrypoints.

Verification:
- SHOWN from later full-suite runs: full suite passed after these commits.
- UNVERIFIED: exact targeted command output for every listed commit is not in
  this retrospective.

Remaining risk:
- LOW to MEDIUM: mostly documentation and compatibility, with some operational
  workflow impact.
- Acceptance state: accepted by later review.
